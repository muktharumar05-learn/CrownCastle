1.	Application is slow, sometimes it shows loaded but not visible.
2.	Coins should have unique IDs.
3.	Coin count is showing but inaccessible after [4].
4.	After moving a coin, the ordering of 3 and 4 is not proper.
5.	Order 3 and 4 is showing 2 coins instead of one.
6.	Background color can help verify coins are in correct position.
7.	After the first move, some pieces disappear (moved/removed/replaced), so the locator order changes.
8.	Refresh resets the board to original position.
9.	Stable DOM structure needed (avoid locator breakage).
10.	Each board cell should have unique coordinate IDs (e.g., cell-a1, cell-h8).
