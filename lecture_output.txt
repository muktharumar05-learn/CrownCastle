**Presentation Title:** 🎓 Smart Money 101: Finance & Investing Basics for Teenagers

**Slide 1: Welcome to Smart Money 101**

🎥 Instructor Script:
“Hi everyone, and welcome to Smart Money 101!
I’m your instructor, and in this course we’re going to break down finance and investing into simple, easy-to-understand lessons.
Here’s what you’ll learn:
● How money really works.
● Why saving early is powerful.
● The basics of investing.
● And how to avoid the common money mistakes most people make.
This course is designed for you — teenagers and young adults — who want to build a smart financial future.
So, let’s dive in!”

**Slide 2: Lesson 1 - What is Money, Really?**

🎥 Instructor Script:
“Before we talk about saving and investing, let’s first ask: What is money, really?
Money is simply a tool.
It lets us trade, save, and invest. But here’s the secret: money loses value over time. That’s called inflation.
So, if you put $10 under your mattress today, in ten years it won’t buy as much as it does now.
That’s why we save and invest — to make sure our money grows faster than inflation.”

**Slide 3: Lesson 1 - What is Money, Really? (continued)**

🎥 Instructor Script:
“Money losing value over time means that inflation exists. For example, if you put $10 under your mattress today and in 10 years it still has the same value, that’s like money not losing any value.”

**Slide 4: Lesson 2 - Budgeting Basics**

🎥 Instructor Script:
“Budgeting is simply telling your money where to go instead of wondering where it went.
One simple rule you can start using today is the 50/30/20 rule:
● 50% of your money goes to needs — food, transport, school stuff.
● 30% goes to wants — fun, entertainment, gadgets.
● And 20% goes to savings and investing.
Think of it like building a pie chart of your money.
If you can follow this habit early, you’ll always have something left for your future.”

**Slide 5: Lesson 2 - Budgeting Basics (continued)**

🎥 Instructor Script:
“Just remember the 50/30/20 rule as a starting point. You can adjust it as needed to fit your lifestyle and goals. The key is to make sure you have something left over each month for savings and investing.”

**Slide 6: Lesson 3 - How Banks Work for You**

🎥 Instructor Script:
“Banks aren’t just for holding money. They can help you grow it safely.
There are three common types of accounts:
1. Checking account – for spending money day-to-day.
2. Savings account – where you earn a small amount of interest.
3. Certificates of Deposit – or CDs – where you lock money for a set time and get higher interest.
Knowing how to use banks wisely will give you a strong foundation for investing later.”

**Slide 7: Lesson 4 - Introduction to Investing**

🎥 Instructor Script:
“Now let’s talk about investing.
Investing means putting your money to work, so it earns more money.
There are a few common types:
● Stocks: You own a piece of a company.
● Bonds: You lend money to governments or businesses.
● ETFs or Mutual Funds: These are baskets of many stocks and bonds.
Here’s the most powerful part: compound interest.
When your money earns interest, and then that interest earns more interest, your money snowballs over time.
That’s how small amounts invested early can grow into big amounts in the future.”

**Slide 8: Lesson 5 - Investing as a Teenager**

🎥 Instructor Script:
“You might be thinking: But I don’t have a lot of money right now!
And that’s okay. Your greatest advantage isn’t money — it’s time.
Here’s an example:
If you invest just $20 a month starting at 16, by the time you’re 40, you could have over $25,000, depending on returns.
Start small:
● Use high-yield savings accounts.
● Try index funds and ETFs.
● Explore beginner-friendly investing apps.
The earlier you start, the easier the future gets.”

**Slide 9: Lesson 6 - Mistakes to Avoid**

🎥 Instructor Script:
“Even smart people make money mistakes. Here are some to avoid:
● Don’t rack up credit card debt.
● Don’t spend all your money on wants.
● Don’t fall for get-rich-quick schemes.
Instead:
● Spend less than you earn.
● Save before you spend.
● Invest consistently.”

**Slide 10: Lesson 7 - Building Your Future Plan**

🎥 Instructor Script:
“Finally, let’s talk about your personal plan.
Ask yourself:
● What do I want in 5 years? Maybe college, travel, or starting a business.
● What do I want in 20 years? Maybe a home, freedom to choose your career, or financial independence.
Write down your goals, then plan backwards. The key is to save, invest, and stay consistent.
Your money is your future — and you’re in control.”

**Slide 11: Final Lesson - Congratulations!**

🎥 Instructor Script:
“Congratulations! You’ve just learned the basics of money, saving, and investing.
Remember:
● Start early.
● Be consistent.
● And avoid the traps.
Your financial journey has already begun — and your future self will thank you for the choices you make today.
Thanks for joining Smart Money 101, and here’s to a smart, successful financial future!”
